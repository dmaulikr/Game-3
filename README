Project for tile-base map games in isometric perspective.

The first thing i'll create is an editor of tile-based map.

For now this editor can 
-create/save/load maps in .map format (simple XML).
-change the attribute of a selected Tile.
-show you a Isometric 3D preview of what the map looks like.

My goal is to improve the Editor to get something quite generic.

I use the LWJGL and slick-util for openGL rendering.
